### Quests
* 10g for finding goblins at **Citadel Altaerin** and reporting

* 10g for returning **Calmont Trenault** (preferred alive)

Humidity - Balmy fallish day

Headed to **Citadel Altaerein**, contracted by the town to investigate what's happening here. About 1 mile north-east-ish of Breachill. Signal fires lit by the goblins inhabiting the Citadel. 

**Warbal** - Ambassador that petitioned the city console to send adventurers. Came with the party north to Citadel but stayed at camp as the party ventured in. 

**Calmont** fired yesterday from Reliant Book Company. Vas (owner) believes he stole a scroll that allowed him to summon the fire mephit.  

**Alak Stagram** 
Alak is a recent recruit into the Hellknight Order of the Nail. Grew up in Varicia. Taken leave from Order of the Nail. Parents served at Citadel. Parents left him a ring and it was stored somewhere safe in Citadel. Mother administered tests for Hellknights. Wants to check crypts but main stairwell has collapsed. Has not seen **Calmont**. 

**Veraid** 
New city where Hellknight's are headquartered. Alak offered to arrest us and take us there.  

Alak took us through some rooms in the Citadel until we were located in a room south of a "central courtyard" with a portcullis. Goblins in the courtyard yell something about "you stupid smelly halfling, what dungeon", while the halfling is asking to be taken to the dungeon.  

Auntie and Bolt threw the portcullis open and stepped out into the courtyard. There was a grappling hook hanging from high on the wall and the rope dangled into the courtyard. 

A pool of standing water is in the left side of the courtyard and from it a monster emerged. It immediately aced Bolt and Auntie, and battle commenced. 

The group was able to slay the beast. Bolt was able to stabilize and Angus was able to craft a quick Elixir of Life and restore Auntie from her death spiral.
